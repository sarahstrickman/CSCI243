1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
/home/stu10/s9/sxs4599


2. What command will list the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories without descending into any directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
ls -l


3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
cd Courses


4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
mkdir csci243


5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -o warning warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems, but there are issues.
    
    a.) What compiler flags are used to enable the display of warnings?

   -Wall 



    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c
	with the recommended compilation options.

    in functon compute:
      - a variable, b, is created, but it isn't used anywhere in the program

    at top level:
      - main should only take 0 or 2 arguments, but there is 1 passed through the function

    unused parameter:
      - The parameter that is passed through main, argc, is 
        not used at any point during the program.  
        It isn't called within the function.

    in function compute:
      - this function doesn't return anything, even 
        though the function indicates 
        that it will return an integer

    in function main:
      - x is used before it is initialized.  
        there is a possibility that the memory address 
        that x points to may contain things that you won't expect 


 
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly to
	produce the output specified in the code documentation.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

    d.) There is a 'super-picky' warning flag; what is it and what problem
	does it catch in warning.c?

        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	:  1 points

    the warning flag that catched 'super-picky stuff' is -pedantic or -Wpedantic 
    in warning.c, this catches the zero length array in main  (the line is int z[0];)



6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

-std=c99

   
7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess
    D. Compile

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

1. preprocess
2. compile
3. assemble
4. link
